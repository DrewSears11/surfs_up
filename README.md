Module 9

### Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to compare the temperatures in the months of June and December to determine whether or not a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.

### Results: 

- As you can see from the tables below - the mean (average) temperature for both June and December are in the 70's.  June is about 75 and December is about 71.
- The coldest day for June was 64 while the coldest day for December was 56.
- The high temperature for June was 85 degrees while December was 83. 
- It did rain more in June as opposed to December as you can see below.

### Summary 

From the results above, I would gather that both a surf shop and ice-cream shop would be sustainable year-round.
The difference in weather is very minor and would not deter me or any person from surfing or eating ice-cream.
A couple additional pieces of data I would like to gather about the weather is potentially winds (average wind speed) which would affect surfing.  Also, potentially if there are any big weather storms (i.e. hurricanes) during each month to determine, if any days would be completely shut down.
